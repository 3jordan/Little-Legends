        <h1>About Little Legends Program</h1>
        <p>Latch-Key is a before and after school program that provides an atmosphere of fun and learning. Each child has the opportunity to receive assistance with homework, socialize with other children, express their creativity, play a variety of board games, use the computers, and participate in small and large motor activities. All of Latch-Key staff is CPR/First Aid certified.</p>
        
        <!-- Delays & Closings -->
        <h2>LATCH-KEY DELAYS & CLOSINGS</h2>
        <p>When school needs to be closed or shortened because of inclement weather, the Latch-Key program will also be cancelled for the day. In the event of a delay, the morning session will still operate on normal hours. If Latch-Key closes after a delay, parents or a person on the emergency list will be contacted to pick up the child. It is important that parents make arrangements for children in the event of an unexpected school closing. Please be sure your phone number is up to date in the office.</p>
